    <p class="description">
        This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs. You can also substitute chicken breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. If you use chicken or rib-eye, you must add thinly sliced green onion tops. This can also be broiled in the oven for the same amount of time.

    <p class="ingredients"> Ingredients

        <li>¾ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>

        <li>½ large onion, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>

    <p class="instructions"> Instructions
        <ol>
            <li>Pour soy sauce, water, vinegar, and sesame oil into a large, non-metallic bowl. Whisk in onion, garlic, brown sugar, white sugar, and pepper, whisking until sugars dissolve. Submerge ribs in the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate 7 to 12 hours; the longer, the better.</li>
